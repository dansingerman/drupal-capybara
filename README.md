This is a skeleton of a pure RSpec and Capybara setup (no Rails necessary) to connect to and test any website.

See my [full post for more setup info](http://victorquinn.com/blog/2012/10/11/using-capybara-and-rspec-to-test-drupal/)

Acknowledgement:
Many thanks to [Jeff Nyman for his article on using RSpec and Capybara without Rails](http://testerstories.com/?p=30). I used this as a starting point while building this.
